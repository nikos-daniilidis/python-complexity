### Complexity science and Machine Learning using Python

The projects under `graphs` and some projects under `cellular_automata` are based on green tea press "thinkcomplexity". 

The projects under `election_fraud` are a tentative study ofthe applicability of Bayes' rule to detecting election fraud. 

Part of the project under `cellular_automata` is a study of complexity science and ML, and is a spin off of some ideas in complexity science and the Santa Fe take on things.

Enjoy :-)
