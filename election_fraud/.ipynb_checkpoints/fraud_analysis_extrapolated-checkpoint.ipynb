On the other hand, the probability of getting percentages that round (in the 2nd & 3rd decimal digit) to 00, 00, 00, 00 is not going to be very different from the probability of getting percentages that round (in 2nd & 3rd digit) to 01, 23, 45, 31, or any other allowed combination, so why single out the former? \n",

    "How can one formulate the layman intuition that four percentages which round so nicely look suspicious? I thought of using the criterion: Find the probability that the rounded percentages can be generated from a simple rule which repeats the same pattern in their 2nd and 3rd decimal digits. For example, the patterns 00, 00, 00, 00 and 25, 25, 25, 25 are the two simplest possible patterns, and will be grouped together when estimating the probability. The probability of getting one of the patterns in the lowest simplicity class is very low ($<10^{-12}$ by a Monte Carlo estimate). This is not entirely satisfactory, as it maintains the distinction between \"suspicious\" and \"non-suspicious\" numbers but hides it behind the idea of \"simple\" vs \"non-simple\" patterns.\n",
